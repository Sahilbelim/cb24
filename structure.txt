what is structure?
    structure means collection of variables. 
    each variable in structure can be of different datatype.
    all the variables in collection must be somehow logically related to each other.
    each variable in structure is called member variable.
    structure is used to create our own datatypes. so it is called user defined datatype.
    structure is used because in c language we can not create single variable which can store different type of value.
    structure can represent real word problems. for example we can create structure student in which we can store all the information of student as single unit.
    we can also pass structure variable into function to reduce arguments in function. and we can also return structure type variable from function to return multiple value from function. 

    how to create structure
    syntax 
    struct structure-name 
    {
        datatype variable;
        datatype variable;
        datatype variable;
    };

    example 
    struct time 
    {
        int hour;
        int minute;
        int sec;
    };

    void main()
    {
        struct time t1,t2;
        t1.hour=24;
        t1.minute=60;
        
    }

      example :2
    struct time 
    {
        int hour;
        int num[5];
        int minute;
    }t1,t[5];


    void main()
    {
      
        t1.hour=24;
        t1.minute=60;
          t2.hour=24;
        t2.minute=60;
        
    }

    we can create array inside structure. which is called array within structure.
    we can create array of structure. which is called array of structure.
